# Term Project for Operations Research@CMU

We extensively studied various algorithms to solve the NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem, and applied those methods in the context of Carnegie Mellon University Campus. We extracted 76 nodes from campus and perform various heuristics Algorithms like
+ Genetic Algorithm
+ Simulated Annealing
+ Nearest Neighbor
and we devised a method to combine Held-Karp algorithm with Clustering to achieve near-optimal results. At the end of this term project, we also proposed to apply graph similarity algorithms to cluster different TSP networks so that best heuristics algorithms can be chosen for new TSP networks in a Supervised Machine Learning way. Code available upon request.
